- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Adrian and I come from Mexico, currently doing my master's thesis in Germany.
- ðŸ‘€ My main interest is applied probability to biologial phenomena, from ecological applications such as distribution of species to neuroscience. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning statistical neuroscience, non-parametric bayesian modelling, siamese neural networks and everything in between. I am also very interested in generative art!
